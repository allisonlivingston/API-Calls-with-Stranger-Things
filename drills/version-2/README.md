# Galvanize Breakout Pong

We've built a game from the tutorial [2D Breakout Game in Pure JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript) using some Galvanize flavoring.

We want to use the [Leaderboard API](https://galvanize-leader-board.herokuapp.com/) to add scores to this game.

Using the `fetch()` API, you will need to:

* [ ] Track all scores under game name `GBP`
* [ ] Fetch the latest scores in `getTopScores()` and pass them to `renderTopScores()`
* [ ] Post the players score in `onGameEnd()` with the appropriate data
* [ ] After posting a new score, refresh latest scores to see if we are a top score


See [rubric](./rubric.md) for specific criteria.
